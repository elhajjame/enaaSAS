### **Mini-Project: Console Calculator**

Code a calculator in **JavaScript** that can perform the following operations:
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
The program must use **separate functions** for each operation.

---

### **Instructions:**

1. Create a program that asks the user to enter **two numbers**.
2. Then, the program asks the user to choose an operation from the following:
   ○ Addition (+)
   ○ Subtraction (-)
   ○ Multiplication (*)
   ○ Division (/)
   ○ Power
   ○ Square root
   ○ Factorial
3. If the user enters an **invalid operator** or tries to **divide by zero**, display an appropriate **error message**.
4. The program must call the **appropriate function** according to the selected operation.
5. Each operation must be implemented in a **separate function**:

   * Function for addition
   * Function for subtraction
   * Function for multiplication
   * Function for division
   * Function to calculate power
   * Function to calculate square root
   * Function to calculate factorial
6. **Store all calculations** in an array.
7. Allow the user to **view the history** of all previous calculations.

### **Program Structure:**

1. **Main menu:** Displays the available choices and waits for user input.
2. **Specific functions:** Each operation (addition, subtraction, etc.) is implemented in a separate function for better organization.
3. **Main loop:** The program remains active until the user chooses to **quit**.
