SAS Brief: Library Management
Project Context

The municipal library of Beni-Mellal wants to modernize its book and subscriber management system.
It has reached out to the startup DigitalGear, where you work as developers, to design a console application in JavaScript.

The application will manage books, subscribers, and borrowings.
Users (librarians) will be able to add, search, and sort books, manage subscribers, and record borrowings/returns.

Objective

Create a JavaScript application to manage a library, allowing tracking of books, subscribers, and borrowings.
The application must include an interactive menu that lets the user choose which operation to perform.

Expected Features

Main Menu

Add a Book

Attributes: Id_livre, Title, Author, Publication Year, Available (yes/no).

Add Multiple Books

Book Operations

Display all books

Sort books by title (ascending/descending)

Sort books by publication year

Display only available books

Search for a book by Id_livre

Subscriber Management

Add a subscriber (ID, Last Name, First Name, Email)

Display all subscribers

Borrowing Management

Record a borrowing (a subscriber borrows an available book → the book becomes “unavailable”)

Record a return (the book becomes “available” again)

Display books borrowed by a specific subscriber

Exit the Application

Note:
After each operation, the user must return to the main menu.

Example Data Structures
let livres = [
  { id_livre: "123", titre: "Le Petit Prince", auteur: "Saint-Exupéry", annee: 1943, disponible: true },
  { id_livre: "456", titre: "L'Étranger", auteur: "Camus", annee: 1942, disponible: true }
];

let abonnes = [
  { id: 1, nom: "Dupont", prenom: "Alice", email: "alice@mail.com" }
];

let emprunts = [
  { abonneId: 1, id_livre: "123", dateEmprunt: "2025-09-22" }
];
